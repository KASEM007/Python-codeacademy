# Write a function named frequency_dictionary that takes a list of
# elements named words as a parameter.
# The function should return a dictionary containing the frequency of
# each element in words.
# Write your frequency_dictionary function here:


def frequency_dictionary(words):
    new_dict = {}
    for word in words:
        if word not in new_dict:
            new_dict[word] = 0
        if word in new_dict:
            new_dict[word] += 1
    return new_dict


# Uncomment these function calls to test your  function:
print(frequency_dictionary(["apple", "apple", "cat", 1]))
# should print {"apple":2, "cat":1, 1:1}
print(frequency_dictionary([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# should print {0:5}
